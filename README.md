Running credit to exciting research that I have referenced for algorithms:

- [BERT-Based Idiom Detection](https://github.com/siddharthyayavaram/BERT-Based-Idiom-Detection/tree/main)
- [Fuzzy dedup using Jaccard similarity](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/fuzzy-dedup/)

TODO: 
- A tiny CLI that lets you:
    - run scraping jobs
    - clean data
    - train the model on some specified dataset
